      <h2>About HoopBoard</h2>
      <p>
        HoopBoard is a digital locker room for athletes, by athletes. I'm Aiden Satterfield, a former D2 basketball player who won three conference championships. I just finished playing ball in March of 2025, and now I'm getting my Master's at NYU. I remember what it was like being in the grind every day.

      <p>
        Whether you're still playing or you're done with college ball, this is your space. Share your story, vent about what's going on, or celebrate your wins. This is real community, no fake stuff.
      </p>

    <div class="about-content">
      <h3>What We're About</h3>
      <p>
        We want to give basketball players a safe place to talk about what's really going on. Mental health, the pressure of college sports, what happens after basketball ends. Stuff that's hard to talk about with coaches or teammates.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Keep It Anonymous?</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of us can't be real about what we're going through because of pressure, or we're worried about how it looks. Being anonymous lets you be honest without worrying about what people think. It helps others know they're not alone.
      </p>

      <h3>Get Involved</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're still playing, just graduated, or been out of the game for years, your story matters. Share what you've been through, support other players, and help build something real for athletes who get it.
