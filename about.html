      <h2>About HoopBoard</h2>
      <p>
        HoopBoard is a digital locker room for athletes, by athletes. Founded by Aiden Satterfield, now a NYU Master's of Science student and former D2, three-time men's basketball conference champion â€” this platform is designed to give players a space to share, reflect, and support each other anonymously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a current player or former college hooper, this is a place for your voice. Share your story, vent your struggles, or celebrate your wins. This is community â€” real, raw, and respectful.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        To create a safe, anonymous space where basketball players can share their authentic experiences, especially around mental health, the challenges of college athletics, and the transition to life after basketball.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Anonymous?</h3>
      <p>
        Many athletes struggle to share their real experiences publicly due to pressure, stigma, or concerns about how it might affect their career. Anonymity allows for honest, vulnerable sharing that can help others feel less alone.
      </p>

      <h3>Join the Community</h3>
      <p>
        Whether you're currently playing, recently graduated, or years removed from the game, your story matters. Share your experiences, support others, and help build a community that understands the unique challenges of being a college athlete.
